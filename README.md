## Overview

The **Weather Forecast App** is a simple web application that allows users to search for current weather conditions and a 7-day forecast for any city around the world. The app fetches real-time data from the OpenWeather API and displays it with intuitive visualizations, including temperature and humidity charts.

## Features

- **Geolocation Support**: Automatically detect the user’s location and provide weather information based on current geographical coordinates.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout that adjusts seamlessly across different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
